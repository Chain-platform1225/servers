## Overview

**_SYNS/Servers_**, an architecture comprising of a collection of Golang-based RESTful microservices, provide a plethora of endpoints that facilitate seamless user interactions with the platform and enable the storage of platform-related information in a MongoDB Atlas client, thus ensuring a robust and efficient data management infrastructure.


## Highlighted Features:

- [SYNS User Microservice](https://github.com/syns-platform/servers/tree/master/syns-users-ms) allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet and sign up for a record in the MongoDB database on their first connection. It also allows users to configure their account or deactivate (delete) it if desired.

- [SYNS Club Microservice](https://github.com/syns-platform/servers/tree/master/syns-club-ms) mimics the logic of the [SynsClub smart contract](https://github.com/syns-platform/contracts/blob/main/contracts/v1/SynsClub.sol) and maintains off-chain records about `SYNS Clubs`.

- [Syns Community Microservice](https://github.com/syns-platform/servers/tree/master/syns-community-ms) is the \***\*`most honored`\*\*** out of the three microservices. Holding many complex endpoints, \***\*Syns Community Microservice\*\*** was developed with the vision of being a full-fledged social media platform which is able to:

  - Allow potential community owners to create an online community where followers can follow for free to receive updates from the owner.

  - Enable community owners to create posts or blogs that followers can interact with by reacting with one of the four `SYNS emotions` (SUPPORT, BRAVO, LAUGH, FIRE), leaving comments, and editing or deleting them as desired.

  - Allow other users to reply to comments and react to them with the `SYNS emotions`.
